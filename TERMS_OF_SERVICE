   products or services, including without limitation all intellectual property rights in any such suggestion or idea.)

6. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. 
  1. Confidential Information Defined. “Confidential Information” refers to the following one party to this Agreement 
   (“Discloser”) discloses to the other (“Recipient”): (a) any document Discloser marks “Confidential”; (b) any 
   information Discloser orally designates as “Confidential” at the time of disclosure, provided Discloser confirms such 
   designation in writing within 30 business days; (c) the non-public features and functions of the Software, for which 
   Vendor is Discloser; and (d) any other nonpublic, sensitive information Recipient should reasonably consider a trade 
   secret or otherwise confidential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include 
   information that: (i) is in Recipient’s possession at the time of disclosure; (ii) is independently developed by 
   Recipient without use of or reference to Confidential Information; (iii) becomes known publicly, before or after 
   disclosure, other than as a result of Recipient’s improper action or inaction; or (iv) is approved for release in 
   writing by Discloser. Recipient is on notice that the Confidential Information may include Discloser’s valuable trade 
   secrets.
  2. Nondisclosure. Recipient shall not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than to facilitate the 
   transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the “Purpose”). Recipient: (a) shall not disclose Confidential 
   Information to any employee or contractor of Recipient unless such person needs access in order to facilitate the 
   Purpose and executes a nondisclosure agreement with Recipient with terms no less restrictive than those of this 
   Article 6; and (b) shall not disclose Confidential Information to any other third party without Discloser’s prior 
   written consent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Recipient shall protect Confidential Information 
   with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of similar nature and importance, 
   but with no less than reasonable care. Recipient shall promptly notify Discloser of any misuse or misappropriation 
   of Confidential Information that comes to Recipient’s attention. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient may disclose 
   Confidential Information as required by applicable law or by proper legal or governmental authority. Recipient shall 
   give Discloser prompt notice of any such legal or governmental demand and reasonably cooperate with Discloser in any 
   effort to seek a protective order or otherwise to contest such required disclosure, at Discloser’s expense.
  3. Injunction. Recipient agrees that breach of this Article 6 would cause Discloser irreparable injury, for which 
   monetary damages would not provide adequate compensation, and that in addition to any other remedy, Discloser will 
   be entitled to injunctive relief against such breach or threatened breach, without proving actual damage or posting 
   a bond or other security.
  4. Termination & Return. With respect to each item of Confidential Information, the obligations of Section 6.2 above 
   (Nondisclosure) will terminate three years after the date of disclosure; provided that such obligations related to 
   Confidential Information constituting Discloser’s trade secrets shall continue so long as such information remains 
   subject to trade secret protection pursuant to applicable law. Upon termination of this Agreement, Recipient shall 
   return all copies of Confidential Information to Discloser or certify, in writing, the destruction thereof.
  5. Retention of Rights. This Agreement does not transfer ownership of Confidential Information or grant a license 
   thereto. Discloser will retain all right, title, and interest in and to all Confidential Information.

   Recipient is on notice and acknowledges that, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement:
    a. IMMUNITY. An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret 
     law for the disclosure of a trade secret that- (A) is made- (i) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local 
     government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting 
     or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or 
     other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.
    b. USE OF TRADE SECRET INFORMATION IN ANTI-RETALIATION LAWSUIT. An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation 
     by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the 
     individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual- (A) files any document 
     containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
 
7. SOFTWARE AUDIT. During the Term of this Agreement and at any time during the 180 days thereafter, Vendor may audit 
 Customer’s use of Licensed Software on 30 days’ advance written notice. Customer shall cooperate with the audit, 
 including by providing access to any books, computers, records, or other information that relate or may relate to use 
 of Licensed Software. Such audit shall not unreasonably interfere with Customer’s business activities. If Vendor 
 discovers unauthorized use, reproduction, distribution, or other exploitation of Licensed Software, in excess of 110% 
 of the copies or fees that would have applied to authorized exploitation, Customer shall reimburse Vendor for the 
 reasonable cost of the audit, or of the next audit in case of discovery without an audit, in addition to such other 
 rights and remedies as Vendor may have. Vendor may not conduct an audit more than once per year.
  
8.  REPRESENTATIONS & WARRANTIES. 
 1. From Vendor. 
    a. Re Function. Vendor represents and warrants that, during the Term, the Software will perform materially as 
     described in its Specifications.
    b. Re IP Rights in the Software. Subject to the next sentence, Vendor represents and warrants that it is the owner 
     of the Software and of each and every component thereof, or the recipient of a valid license thereto, and that it 
     has and will maintain the full power and authority to grant the intellectual property rights to the Software set 
     forth in this Agreement without the further consent of any third party. Vendor’s representations and warranties in 
     the preceding sentence do not apply to the extent that the infringement arises out of any of the conditions listed 
     in Subsections 9.1(a) through 9.1(e) below. In the event of a breach of the warranty in this Subsection 8.1(b), 
     Vendor, at its own expense, will promptly take the following actions: (i) secure for Customer the right to continue 
     using the Software; or (ii) replace or modify the Software to make it noninfringing, provided such modification or 
     replacement will not materially degrade any functionality listed in the Specifications. In conjunction with Customer’s 
     right to terminate for breach where applicable and the provisions of Section 9.1 below (Indemnified Claims), the 
     preceding sentence states Vendor’s sole obligation and liability, and Customer’s sole remedy, for breach of the 
     warranty in this Subsection 8.1(b) and for potential or actual intellectual property infringement by the Software.
  2. From Both Parties. Each party represents and warrants that it has the full right and authority to enter into, 
    execute, and perform its obligations under this Agreement and that no pending or threatened claim or litigation 
    known to it would have a material adverse impact on its ability to perform as required by this Agreement.
  3. Warranty Disclaimers. Except for the express warranties in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 above, VENDOR MAKES NO WARRANTIES, 
   EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A 
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Vendor does not warrant that the Software will perform without error or that it will run without 
   immaterial interruption. Vendor provides no warranty regarding, and will have no responsibility for, any claim arising 
   out of: (a) a modification of the Software made by anyone other than Vendor, unless Vendor approves such modification 
   in writing; or (b) use of the Software in combination with any operating system not authorized in the Specifications 
   or Documentation or with hardware or software specifically forbidden by the Specifications or Documentation.
  
9. INDEMNIFICATION. 
  1. Indemnified Claims. Vendor shall defend and indemnify Customer and Customer’s Associates (as defined below) against 
   any “Indemnified Claim,” meaning any third party claim, suit, or proceeding arising out of, related to, or alleging 
   direct infringement of any patent, copyright, trade secret, or other intellectual property right by the Software. 
   Vendor’s obligations set forth in this Section 9.1 do not apply to the extent that an Indemnified Claim arises out of: 
   (a) Customer’s breach of this Agreement; (b) revisions to the Software made without Vendor’s written consent; 
   (c) Customer’s failure to incorporate Upgrades that would have avoided the alleged infringement, provided Vendor offered 
   such Upgrades without charges not otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement; (d) Vendor’s modification of Software in 
   compliance with specifications provided by Customer; or (e) use of the Software in combination with hardware or software 
   not provided by Vendor. In the event of an Indemnified Claim, Vendor may exercise the remedies in Subsections 
   8.1(b)(i) through 8.1(b)(ii) above. (As used in this Article 9, Customer’s “Associates” are its officers, directors, 
   shareholders, parents, subsidiaries, agents, successors, and assigns.)
  2. Litigation & Additional Terms. Vendor’s obligations pursuant to Section 10.1 above will be excused to the extent 
   that Customer’s or any of Customer’s Associates’ failure to provide prompt notice of the Indemnified Claim or reasonably 
   to cooperate materially prejudices the defense. Vendor will control the defense of any Indemnified Claim, including 
   appeals, negotiations, and any settlement or compromise thereof; provided Customer will have the right, not to be 
   exercised unreasonably, to reject any settlement or compromise that requires that it admit wrongdoing or liability or 
   subjects it to any ongoing affirmative obligations.
  
10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 

  1. Dollar Cap. VENDOR’S CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED

  7. U.S. Government Restricted Rights. The Software and Documentation are commercial items, as that term is defined in 
   48 CFR 2.101, consisting of commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation, as those terms 
   are used in 48 CFR 12.212. If the Software or Documentation is acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. government or by a 
   U.S. government contractor (including without limitation prime contractors and subcontractors at any tier), then in 
   accordance with 48 CFR 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense licenses only) and 48 CFR 12.212 (for licenses with all 
   federal government agencies), the government’s rights to the Software and Documentation are limited to the commercial 
   rights specifically granted in this Agreement, as restricted by this Agreement. The rights limited by the preceding 
   sentence include, without limitation, any rights to reproduce, modify, perform, display, disclose, release, or 
   otherwise use the Software or Documentation. This Section 12.7 does not grant Customer any rights not specifically set 
   forth in this Agreement.

   (collectively, the “License Provisions”) are licenses to “intellectual property” rights, as defined in Section 365(n) 
   of the United States Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. Sections 101, et seq.). If Vendor is subject to any proceeding under 
   the United States Bankruptcy Code, and Vendor as debtor in possession or its trustee in bankruptcy rejects this 
   Agreement, Customer may, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Section 365(n)(1) and (2), retain any and all rights granted to it under 
   the License Provisions to the maximum extent permitted by law. This Section 12.8 will not be construed to limit or 
   restrict any right or remedy not set forth in this Section 12.8, including without limitation the right to retain any 
   license or authority this Agreement grants pursuant to any provision other than the License Provisions.
  9. Choice of Law & Arbitration: This Agreement will be governed solely by the internal laws of the State of New York 
   including without limitation applicable federal law, without reference to: (a) any conflicts of law principle that would 
   apply the substantive laws of another jurisdiction to the parties’ rights or duties; (b) the 1980 United Nations 
   Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods; or (c) other international laws. Any claim, dispute, or 
   controversy (“Claim”) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the relationships among the parties hereto shall 
   be resolved by one arbitrator through binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the expedited procedures set 
   forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) as those Rules exist on the effective 
   date of this Agreement, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final, 
   binding, and non-appealable. Judgment upon the award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. 
   This clause is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal 
   Arbitration Act. Neither party shall sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of this 
   clause or of the arbitrator’s award; any such suit may be brought only in a Federal District Court or a New York state 
   court located in New York County, New York. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have 
   exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, 
   arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement including any claim that all or any part of the Agreement 
   is void or voidable.
  10. Technology Export. Customer shall not: (a) permit any third party to access or use the Software in violation of any 
   U.S. law or regulation; or (b) export the Software or otherwise remove it from the United States except in compliance 
   with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer shall not 
   permit any third party to access or use the Software in, or export it to, a country subject to a United States embargo 
   (as of the Effective Date, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria).

   contemporaneous writings, negotiations, and discussions with respect to its subject matter. Neither party has relied 
   upon any such prior or contemporaneous communications.
  12. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts. Each counterpart will be an 
   original, but all such counterparts will constitute a single instrument. The Customer may also execute this Agreement
